`daemonize2` is a library for writing [SysV daemons](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/daemon.7.html). It is inspired by the Python library [`daemonize`](https://github.com/thesharp/daemonize) and is based on the original [`daemonize` crate](https://github.com/knsd/daemonize) that went unmaintained.
